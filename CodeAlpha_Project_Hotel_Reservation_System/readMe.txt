The Hotel Reservation System is a beginner-friendly software project designed to introduce learners to the fundamentals of programming and project development. Its primary objective is to demonstrate how a formal software application is structured, focusing on basic programming principles like object-oriented design, data handling, and user interaction. This project is intentionally kept simple and contains redundancy to ensure beginners do not feel overwhelmed. It provides a stepping stone for learners to grasp the concepts of project development while offering room for modifications and enhancements.

The system revolves around three main classes: Room, Customer, and Hotel. The Room class represents individual rooms in the hotel, encapsulating properties such as room number, type, amenities (like kitchen and bathroom), price, booking status, and customer information. Each room can either be booked or available, with the customer details stored if it is booked. The Customer class stores information about customers, such as their name, phone number, account number, and account balance. It also includes a feature to display customer details, which is used when viewing booking information. The Hotel class is the central component of the system, managing all rooms and enabling various operations like checking room availability, making reservations, viewing room details, and more.

The system initializes by creating a list of rooms using an ArrayList. Each room is added to the list with predefined details, simulating a database of hotel rooms. For quick and efficient retrieval of room information, the system organizes these rooms into a HashMap, where the room number acts as the key and the room object as the value. This structure allows the system to quickly access any room’s details by its number.

When the system starts, it presents the user with a console-based menu. This menu offers several options:

Check Available Rooms: Displays all rooms that are not currently booked.
Check Room Status: Prompts the user to input a room number and shows whether the room is booked or available.
Make a Reservation: Allows the user to book a room by providing personal details like name, phone, and account number. The system verifies the user’s balance, deducts the room price, updates the booking status, and associates the customer with the room.
View Room Categorization: Displays detailed information about a specific room, including its type, price, availability, and list of amenities.
View Booking Details: Displays the details of the customer who booked a particular room, or indicates that the room is unbooked if no customer is associated with it.
Exit Program: Closes the application.
The reservation process is designed to be interactive and beginner-friendly. If the user selects a room to book, the system checks its availability, verifies if the provided payment matches the room price, and then updates the room's status and customer information. If there is an error, such as insufficient balance or an incorrect amount, the system provides clear feedback to guide the user.

One of the highlights of this system is its simplicity. It uses basic programming constructs like loops, conditional statements, and object-oriented principles to ensure that beginners can follow the logic without being confused by complex abstractions. The redundancy in the code (e.g., repeated initialization of room details) makes it more explicit, so beginners can clearly see how the data is being handled.

This project is also highly extensible. For example, learners can add features such as room cancellation, search filters for rooms by type or price, or even integrate a database to persist room and customer data. They could also optimize existing code by reducing redundancy or improving performance, thereby learning the principles of code refactoring and enhancement.

Overall, the Hotel Reservation System serves as an educational tool to introduce beginners to software project development. It is simple enough for learners to understand while being flexible enough to encourage experimentation and growth. This project not only teaches programming concepts but also provides insight into how to approach building a formal system, making it a perfect foundation for beginners in software development.
